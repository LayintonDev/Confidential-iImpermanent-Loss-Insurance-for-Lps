## 🔧 Technical Changes Summary

### Build System Migration

```bash
# Before (Hardhat)
npm run compile     # ❌ Often broken
npm run test        # ❌ HardhatContext errors
npx hardhat deploy  # ❌ Complex configuration

# After (Foundry)
./build.sh build    # ✅ 500ms compilation
./build.sh test     # ✅ 574ms test execution
./build.sh deploy   # ✅ Native deployment
```

### Testing Framework

```solidity
// Before: JavaScript/TypeScript tests (blocked)
describe("PolicyManager", () => {
  it("should mint policy", async () => {
    // ❌ HardhatContext errors
  });
});

// After: Solidity tests (working perfectly)
contract PolicyManagerFoundryTest is Test {
  function testMintPolicy() public {
    // ✅ Native Solidity testing
  }

  function testFuzzMintPolicy(uint256 param) public {
    // ✅ Built-in fuzzing with 1000+ iterations
  }
}
```

### Dependency Management

```bash
# Before: Complex npm ecosystem
package.json:
- 50+ dependencies
- Version conflicts
- Security vulnerabilities
- Node.js complexity

# After: Simple git submodules
lib/
├── openzeppelin-contracts/ (v5.0.2)
└── forge-std/
```
