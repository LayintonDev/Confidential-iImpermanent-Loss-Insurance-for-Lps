- **Gate:** End-to-end claim payout on local network

### Week 6 Milestone: Production Frontend

- Complete user interface with real transactions
- Professional UX for all user flows
- **Gate:** External user can complete full journey

### Week 8 Milestone: Security & Testing Complete

- All security testing and auditing complete
- Property tests and mainnet fork tests passing
- **Gate:** System ready for production deployment

### Week 10 Milestone: Hookthon Submission

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks

- **Uniswap v4 Changes:** Mock v4 interfaces if official ones unavailable
- **EigenLayer Integration:** Enhanced mocking if production AVS unavailable
- **Fhenix Integration:** Comprehensive mocking with production-ready interfaces
- **Gas Optimization:** Early benchmarking and continuous optimization

### Timeline Risks

- **Phase Overruns:** Built-in 20% buffer for each phase
- **Dependency Delays:** Parallel work streams where possible
- **Scope Creep:** Strict adherence to MVP definition until Phase 8

### Demo/Presentation Risks

- **Technical Failures:** Multiple backup demo environments
- **Network Issues:** Local demo capability as fallback
- **Presentation Quality:** Professional video production as primary medium
