## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks

- **Uniswap v4 Changes:** Mock v4 interfaces if official ones unavailable
- **EigenLayer Integration:** Enhanced mocking if production AVS unavailable
- **Fhenix Integration:** Comprehensive mocking with production-ready interfaces
- **Gas Optimization:** Early benchmarking and continuous optimization

### Timeline Risks

- **Phase Overruns:** Built-in 20% buffer for each phase
- **Dependency Delays:** Parallel work streams where possible
- **Scope Creep:** Strict adherence to MVP definition until Phase 8

### Demo/Presentation Risks

- **Technical Failures:** Multiple backup demo environments
- **Network Issues:** Local demo capability as fallback
- **Presentation Quality:** Professional video production as primary medium
