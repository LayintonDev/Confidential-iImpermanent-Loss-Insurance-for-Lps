# Phase 8: Operator Economics, Slashing & Documentation

## Epic Overview

Implement comprehensive operator economic model, enhanced slashing mechanisms, tranche accounting system, and complete project documentation for production readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Operator economic model with rewards, slashing, and stake management
- [ ] Advanced slashing mechanisms for various misbehavior types
- [ ] Tranche accounting system for risk-based premium allocation
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation covering architecture, deployment, and operations
- [ ] Admin interfaces for system management and governance

## Technical Requirements

### Enhanced Operator Economic Model

#### Operator Stake Management

```solidity
contract OperatorStakeManager {
    struct OperatorInfo {
        uint256 stake;
        uint256 delegatedStake;
        uint256 rewardBalance;
        uint256 slashingHistory;
        uint256 lastActivityBlock;
        bool isActive;
    }

    function registerOperator(uint256 minStake) external payable;
    function delegateStake(address operator) external payable;
    function claimRewards() external;
    function withdrawStake(uint256 amount) external;
}
```

- [ ] Operator registration with minimum stake requirements
- [ ] Delegation mechanism for external stakers
- [ ] Reward calculation based on attestation accuracy and uptime
- [ ] Withdrawal delays for security (7-day unbonding period)
- [ ] Operator performance metrics tracking

#### Reward Distribution System

```solidity
library RewardMath {
    function calculateOperatorReward(
        uint256 totalPremiums,
        uint256 operatorStake,
        uint256 totalStake,
        uint256 performanceScore
    ) external pure returns (uint256);
}
```

- [ ] Proportional reward distribution based on stake and performance
- [ ] Performance scoring: accuracy, uptime, response time
- [ ] Base reward rate: 5% of collected premiums
- [ ] Bonus rewards for exceptional performance
- [ ] Penalty reductions for poor performance

### Advanced Slashing Mechanisms

#### Slashing Conditions & Penalties

```solidity
enum SlashingReason {
    InvalidAttestation,     // 10% slash
    DoubleAttestation,      // 20% slash
    Unavailability,         // 5% slash
    ConspiracyParticipation,// 50% slash
    MaliciousSignature      // 100% slash (full)
}

contract EnhancedSlashing {
    function proposeSlashing(address operator, SlashingReason reason, bytes calldata evidence) external;
    function executeSlashing(uint256 proposalId) external;
    function appealSlashing(uint256 slashingId, bytes calldata counterEvidence) external;
}
```

- [ ] Graduated slashing based on severity
- [ ] Evidence-based slashing with challenge period
- [ ] Multi-signature approval for large slashing events
- [ ] Appeals process with counter-evidence submission
- [ ] Automatic slashing for provable on-chain misbehavior

#### Misbehavior Detection

```solidity
contract MisbehaviorDetector {
    function checkAttestationConsistency(uint256 policyId, bytes[] calldata attestations) external view returns (bool);
    function detectDoubleAttestation(address operator, bytes calldata att1, bytes calldata att2) external pure returns (bool);
    function verifyOperatorUptime(address operator, uint256 windowBlocks) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

- [ ] Automated detection of conflicting attestations
- [ ] Uptime monitoring with missed attestation tracking
- [ ] Cross-validation of attestation results
- [ ] Pattern detection for coordinated attacks
- [ ] Grace periods for legitimate infrastructure issues

### Tranche Accounting System

#### Risk-Based Premium Allocation

```solidity
contract TrancheManager {
    struct Tranche {
        uint256 riskLevel;      // 1 = low risk, 5 = high risk
        uint256 premiumMultiplier; // basis points above base rate
        uint256 reserves;       // allocated reserves
        uint256 maxExposure;    // maximum total exposure
        uint256 utilizationRate; // current utilization %
    }

    function allocateToTranche(address pool, uint256 amount, uint8 trancheLevel) external;
    function rebalanceTranches() external;
    function calculateRiskScore(address pool) external view returns (uint8);
}
```

- [ ] 5-tier risk classification system
- [ ] Dynamic premium multipliers based on tranche utilization
- [ ] Automated rebalancing between tranches
- [ ] Pool risk scoring based on volatility, volume, and history
- [ ] Cross-tranche contagion protection

#### Advanced Reserve Management

```solidity
library ReserveAccounting {
    function calculateRequiredReserves(uint256[] memory exposures, uint8[] memory riskLevels) external pure returns (uint256);
    function optimizeReserveAllocation(uint256 totalReserves, uint256[] memory trancheExposures) external pure returns (uint256[] memory);
}
```

- [ ] Risk-weighted reserve requirements
- [ ] Capital adequacy ratios per tranche
- [ ] Stress testing for reserve sufficiency
- [ ] Automated reserve reallocation
- [ ] Emergency reserve pools for extreme events

### Administrative & Governance Features

#### System Administration

```solidity
contract SystemAdmin {
    function pauseSystem(bool pause) external onlyGovernance;
    function updateOperatorSet(address[] calldata newOperators) external onlyGovernance;
    function adjustGlobalParameters(SystemParams calldata newParams) external onlyGovernance;
    function emergencyWithdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyEmergency;
}
```

- [ ] Multi-signature governance for critical operations
- [ ] Timelocks for parameter changes
- [ ] Emergency pause functionality
- [ ] Operator set management
- [ ] Fee parameter adjustments

#### Monitoring & Analytics

```solidity
contract SystemMetrics {
    function getVaultHealth() external view returns (VaultHealth memory);
    function getOperatorPerformance(address operator) external view returns (PerformanceMetrics memory);
    function getTrancheUtilization() external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    function getSystemStatistics() external view returns (SystemStats memory);
}
```

- [ ] Real-time system health monitoring
- [ ] Operator performance dashboards
- [ ] Financial metrics and KPIs
- [ ] Risk exposure monitoring
- [ ] Historical trend analysis
