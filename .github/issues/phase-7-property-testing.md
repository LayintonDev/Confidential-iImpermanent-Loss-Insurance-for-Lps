# Phase 7: Property Testing & Mainnet Fork Testing

## Epic Overview

Implement comprehensive property-based testing, fuzz testing, mainnet fork scenarios, and formal invariant verification to ensure system robustness and security.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Property-based tests verify IL math invariants across all scenarios
- [ ] Fuzz testing covers edge cases in contract interactions
- [ ] Mainnet fork tests simulate real market conditions and stress scenarios
- [ ] Formal invariants are documented and verified in code comments
- [ ] Security testing identifies and addresses potential vulnerabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Property-Based Testing (Foundry)

#### IL Math Invariants

```solidity
// Properties to verify for all valid inputs
contract ILMathProperties is Test {
    function testProperty_ILAlwaysNonNegative(uint256 x0, uint256 y0, uint256 x1, uint256 y1, uint256 P1) public;
    function testProperty_PayoutNeverExceedsCap(uint256 V_hodl, uint16 capBps) public;
    function testProperty_DeductibleIsProperlyApplied(uint256 IL, uint16 deductibleBps) public;
    function testProperty_NoArbitrageInILCalculation() public;
}
```

- [ ] **Invariant 1**: IL ≥ 0 for all valid price movements
- [ ] **Invariant 2**: Payout ≤ capBps \* V_hodl / 10,000
- [ ] **Invariant 3**: Payout ≤ IL (cannot pay more than actual loss)
- [ ] **Invariant 4**: Deductible is subtracted before cap is applied
- [ ] **Invariant 5**: Mathematical operations never overflow/underflow

#### Hook Behavior Properties

- [ ] **Invariant 6**: Premium collection never exceeds total swap fees
- [ ] **Invariant 7**: Policy can only be claimed once
- [ ] **Invariant 8**: Only policy owner can initiate claims
- [ ] **Invariant 9**: Vault reserves always equal sum of deposited premiums minus payouts
- [ ] **Invariant 10**: No unauthorized access to vault funds

### Comprehensive Fuzz Testing

#### Input Fuzzing Scenarios

```solidity
function testFuzz_PremiumCalculation(
    uint128 feeGrowthGlobal0,
    uint128 feeGrowthGlobal1,
    uint16 premiumBps,
    address pool
) public {
    // Fuzz premium calculation with extreme values
    vm.assume(premiumBps <= 10000); // Max 100%
    vm.assume(pool != address(0));
    // Test implementation
}
```

- [ ] Fuzz premium calculation with extreme fee growth values
- [ ] Fuzz IL calculations with extreme price ratios (1:1000000, etc.)
- [ ] Fuzz policy parameters (0% to 100% cap/deductible)
- [ ] Fuzz timing scenarios (claim immediately vs. after long delay)
- [ ] Fuzz multiple LP interactions in same pool

#### Edge Case Generation

- [ ] Zero amounts in liquidity operations
- [ ] Maximum uint256 values for price and amounts
- [ ] Dust amounts and precision loss scenarios
- [ ] Concurrent operations from multiple users
- [ ] Chain reorganization scenarios

### Mainnet Fork Testing

#### Historical Scenario Testing

```typescript
describe("Mainnet Fork Scenarios", () => {
  it("Should handle May 2021 crash scenario", async () => {
    // Fork mainnet at block before crash
    // Deploy contracts
    // Simulate positions during crash
    // Verify payouts are accurate
  });
});
```

- [ ] **May 2021 Crypto Crash**: Test extreme volatility scenario
- [ ] **DeFi Summer 2020**: Test high volume, high fees scenario
- [ ] **Black Thursday 2020**: Test extreme IL during market stress
- [ ] **Normal Market Conditions**: Test steady-state operations
- [ ] **MEV Attack Scenarios**: Test resistance to sandwich attacks

#### Stress Testing Scenarios

- [ ] 1000+ concurrent policies in single pool
- [ ] Vault reaching insolvency threshold
- [ ] Gas limit scenarios during high network congestion
- [ ] Oracle failure and recovery scenarios
- [ ] Large position exits causing significant IL

#### Real Pool Integration

- [ ] Test against actual Uniswap v3 pools (for reference behavior)
- [ ] Verify premium calculations match real swap fee generation
- [ ] Test with multiple fee tiers (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%)
- [ ] Validate IL calculations against known historical positions

### Security & Attack Vector Testing

#### Economic Attack Vectors

```solidity
contract SecurityTests {
    function testAttack_InflatePremiumsViaSelfSwap() public;
    function testAttack_ClaimManipulationViaOracle() public;
    function testAttack_VaultDrainViaReentrancy() public;
    function testAttack_PolicyFrontRunning() public;
}
```

- [ ] Test premium inflation through self-trading
- [ ] Test oracle manipulation for favorable IL calculations
- [ ] Test reentrancy attacks on vault functions
- [ ] Test front-running of policy creation/claims
- [ ] Test denial-of-service via gas exhaustion

#### Contract Security Testing

- [ ] Static analysis with Slither
- [ ] Formal verification with Certora (if resources allow)
- [ ] Mythril analysis for common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Manual code review checklist
- [ ] Access control verification

### Formal Invariant Documentation

#### Mathematical Invariants (in code comments)

```solidity
/**
 * FORMAL INVARIANTS:
 *
 * [INV-1] Conservation of Value:
 *   sum(vault_reserves) + sum(payouts_made) == sum(premiums_collected)
 *
 * [INV-2] IL Calculation Correctness:
 *   For any position (x0,y0) -> (x1,y1) with price P0 -> P1:
 *   IL = max(0, (x0*P1 + y0) - (x1*P1 + y1 + fees_collected))
 *
 * [INV-3] Payout Bounds:
 *   0 <= payout <= min(IL, capBps * V_hodl / 10000)
 *   where IL >= deductibleBps * IL / 10000 must hold for any payout > 0
 */
```

- [ ] Specify operator slashing conditions
- [ ] Define claim processing timeouts
- [ ] Establish fee distribution rules
- [ ] Outline emergency pause conditions
