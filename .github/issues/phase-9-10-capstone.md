# Phase 9-10 Capstone: Demo Packaging & Hookthon Submission

## Epic Overview

Create comprehensive demo materials, deploy to testnet, record demonstration videos, and prepare complete Hookthon submission package with all required materials.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete system deployed and functional on public testnet
- [ ] Professional demo video showcasing all three Hookthon scenarios
- [ ] Comprehensive submission package with pitch deck and technical documentation
- [ ] Live demo environment accessible for judges and community
- [ ] All demo scripts are automated and reproducible

## Technical Requirements

### Testnet Deployment

#### Multi-Network Deployment Strategy

```typescript
// Deploy script supporting multiple networks
const deploymentConfig = {
  sepolia: {
    rpcUrl: process.env.SEPOLIA_RPC,
    deployerKey: process.env.SEPOLIA_DEPLOYER_KEY,
    uniswapV4Core: "0x...", // Mock or actual v4 if available
  },
  arbitrumGoerli: {
    // Alternative testnet configuration
  },
  polygonMumbai: {
    // Third option for redundancy
  },
};
```

- [ ] Deploy complete contract suite to primary testnet (Sepolia)
- [ ] Deploy backup instance to secondary testnet
- [ ] Configure all contract interactions and dependencies
- [ ] Verify contracts on block explorers (Etherscan, etc.)
- [ ] Set up testnet ETH faucets and token distributions

#### Production-Ready Deployment Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-production.sh
echo "ðŸš€ Deploying Confidential IL Insurance Hook to $NETWORK"

# Deploy core contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/01-deploy-core.ts --network $NETWORK
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/02-configure-operators.ts --network $NETWORK
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/03-setup-governance.ts --network $NETWORK
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/04-verify-deployment.ts --network $NETWORK

echo "âœ… Deployment complete. Contracts verified on $EXPLORER"
```

- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline with verification
- [ ] Post-deployment configuration and testing
- [ ] Contract address registry for frontend integration
- [ ] Deployment documentation with network details
- [ ] Emergency rollback procedures

### Demo Infrastructure

#### Live Demo Environment

#### Demo Data & Scenarios

```typescript
// Automated demo scenario runner
class DemoScenarioRunner {
  async runScenarioA_AutoPayout(): Promise<DemoResult> {
    // LP creates insured position
    // Price drifts significantly
    // LP removes liquidity
    // System automatically processes payout
  }

  async runScenarioB_DynamicPremiums(): Promise<DemoResult> {
    // High volatility period
    // Premium rates adjust dynamically
    // Multiple claims processed
  }

  async runScenarioC_DisputeSlashing(): Promise<DemoResult> {
    // Bad attestation submitted
    // Dispute mechanism triggered
    // Operator slashing executed
  }
}
```

- [ ] Automated scenario execution for consistent demos
