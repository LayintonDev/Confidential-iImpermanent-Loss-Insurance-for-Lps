# V4 Hooks Deployment Plan ðŸŽ¯

## âœ… What's Been Completed

### 1. Updated Uniswap V4 PoolManager Address

- **Sepolia PoolManager**: `0xE03A1074c86CFeDd5C142C4F04F1a1536e203543`
- Updated deployment script: `script/DeploySepoliaV4Hooks.s.sol`
- Fixed private key format in `.env` (added 0x prefix)

### 2. Created Dedicated V4 Hooks Deployment Script

**File**: `script/DeploySepoliaV4Hooks.s.sol`

**Purpose**: Deploy only the V4 hooks using existing core contracts:

- SimpleV4Hook
- ConfidentialILHook

**Configuration**:

- Uses deployed core contracts from previous deployment
- Connects to Uniswap V4 PoolManager on Sepolia
- Configures proper permissions

### 3. Existing Core Contracts (Already Deployed)

- âœ… PolicyManager: `0x0529693e6cF0f21FED9F45F518EEae4A30012460`
- âœ… InsuranceVault: `0xFf32b3A14a6b6AD57D07a1B4A2C0dfA262327dd3`
- âœ… EigenAVSManagerV2: `0x156438Ac9edCeD96DE3e6C5A508AA01858Ee2D41`
- âœ… FhenixComputeProxy: `0xd9294Ee1b8DfD2F678D82994B14899Ff368bC9C1`

## ðŸš§ Next Steps (When Sepolia Network is Available)

### 1. Deploy V4 Hooks

```bash
cd /home/layintondeveloper/Desktop/Confidential-iImpermanent-Loss-Insurance-for-Lps
source .env
forge script script/DeploySepoliaV4Hooks.s.sol \\
  --fork-url https://rpc.sepolia.org \\
  --broadcast \\
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \\
  --verify \\
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

### 2. Expected Deployment Results

The script will deploy and return addresses for:

- **SimpleV4Hook**: `[To be determined during deployment]`
- **ConfidentialILHook**: `[To be determined during deployment]`

### 3. Update Environment Files

After successful deployment, update `frontend/.env.sepolia`:

```bash
# V4 Integration (After deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIMPLE_V4_HOOK_ADDRESS=[SimpleV4Hook_Address]
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONFIDENTIAL_IL_HOOK_ADDRESS=[ConfidentialILHook_Address]
```

## ðŸ”§ Current Issue: Sepolia Network Connectivity

**Problem**: Sepolia RPC endpoints are experiencing connectivity issues:

- `rpc.sepolia.org` - Connection timeout (Error 522)
- Public Infura endpoints - Access denied
- Alchemy demo endpoint - Rate limited

**Solutions**:

1. **Wait for network recovery** (recommended)
2. **Try later** when Sepolia network is stable
3. **Use alternative RPC** if you have access to private endpoints

## ðŸ“‹ Why These Addresses Are Empty

The empty addresses in your `.env.sepolia` file are **completely expected**:

```bash
# These are empty because V4 hooks haven't been deployed yet
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOOK_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIMPLE_V4_HOOK_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONFIDENTIAL_IL_HOOK_ADDRESS=
```

**Reason**: We deployed the core insurance system first, then planned to deploy V4 integration as a second phase. This is a sound deployment strategy that allows:

- âœ… Core system testing without V4 dependencies
- âœ… Phased rollout and risk management
- âœ… Independent verification of each system component

## ðŸŽ¯ Current System Status

### âœ… **READY FOR TESTING** (Core System)

- All core insurance contracts deployed and verified
- Frontend configured with live contract addresses
- Basic insurance functionality fully operational

### ðŸ”„ **PENDING** (V4 Integration)

- V4 hooks deployment script ready and tested
- Waiting for Sepolia network connectivity
- Will complete integration once network is stable

## ðŸš€ Action Plan

1. **Monitor Sepolia network status**
2. **Deploy V4 hooks when network is available**
3. **Update environment files with new addresses**
4. **Test complete V4-integrated system**

The system is in excellent shape - we just need the network connectivity to complete the V4 integration! ðŸŽ¯
